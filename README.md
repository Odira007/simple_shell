# Simple Shell
This repository contains the creation of a unix command line interpreter that handles a series of commands. The shell is a program that interacts with the user through a terminalor takes the input of a file and executes a sequence of commands that are passed to the operating system. The shell is expected to work exactly like the thompson shell. The shell program must have the same output as sh(bin/sh), as well as the same error output.
